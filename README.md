# Hand-Pose-detction
In this video, we demonstrate how to detect and track 21 3D hand landmarks in real-time using Googleâ€™s MediaPipe framework. MediaPipe provides fast, lightweight, and accurate hand tracking powered by machine learning, making it ideal for gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, AR/VR applications, and more.

# Tools
Install MediaPipe and OpenCV for hand tracking:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
